**Inroduction to student managment system**

The Student Management System is  simple and  effective software designed to help schools manage their student information. It stores details like names, phone numbers, addresses, grades, and classes, of students and  makes it easy for school administrators to keep track of their students’ records. The system is built using Python, and it uses basic programming patterns and OOP pillars to ensure that it runs smoothly and securely.
 
  In order to run the program itself the administrator shuld login and put the password for now the login is "admin" and password is "password", after you login the program starts to work and you will see main menu with options which are each numbered.

By pressing the number of the option you can:

Get Student Details: Look up a student by their roll number to see their full information.

Add New Student: Enter details to register a new student into the system.

Remove Student: Remove a student’s information using their roll number.

Update Student Details: Change information for an existing student.

Update School ORGNAME: Modify the name of the school in the system.

Get Number of Students: See how many students are currently enrolled.

Get All Students' Details: View a list of all students and their information.

Firstly user should  add  new student by pressing "2", and then you should add students information like its shown in the picture:

After each option is sellected and some action is done the programs asks "Do you want to continue or not" and you can chose it simply by pressing "y" yes or "n" no.

But you need to make sure to press the correct button if not the system is going to output an error

Later on  user can work with sistem by adding more student or deliting the information about them, even by changing the name of the school and other options.

Each option is selected by typing a number or command into the system. The system is designed to be user-friendly, even for those who are not very tech-savacious. All data is saved in a simple JSON file, making it easy to back up or move as needed.

**Body Analysis of the code** 

During creation of the code most of the fundamental principles of object oriented programing were used,Lets look at them:

**Polymorphism:** 

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. In the system, polymorphism is exhibited through the save() and load() methods of the StorageHandler class, which can be overridden in subclasses like FileStorageHandler to perform operations specific to file handling.

```ruby
class StorageHandler:
    def save(self, data):
        pass

    def load(self):
        pass

class FileStorageHandler(StorageHandler):
    def save(self, data):
        with open(self.filename, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(data, file)

    def load(self):
        with open(self.filename, 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)

```
**Abstraction**

Abstraction is implemented through the creation of abstract behaviors in the StorageHandler class, which defines a template for saving and loading data without specifying the details of how each operation is carried out.

```ruby
class StorageHandler:
    def save(self, data):
        pass

    def load(self):
        pass

```

**Inheritance**

Inheritance is a key feature used in the system to extend the functionality of the base class. The Student class inherits from the Person class, enabling it to use and extend the properties and methods of Person.

```ruby
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, address, phone):
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
        self.phone = phone

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, roll_no=None, name=None, phone_number=None, address=None, grade=None, student_class=None):
        super().__init__(name, address, phone_number)
        # Additional attributes and methods specific to Student


```


**Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is used to restrict access to the internal state of an object and only allow modification through methods. The Student class encapsulates student information and provides methods like update_student() to modify this data safely.

```ruby
class Student(Person):
    def update_student(self):
        # Allows updating student details in a controlled manner
        self.name = input("\tEnter new student name: ")



```
**Design Patterns Implementation**



**Singleton Pattern**

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is implemented in the AuthenticationManager class, which manages user authentication throughout the system.

```ruby
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class AuthenticationManager(metaclass=Singleton\Meta):
    # Implementation details


```

**Factory Pattern**

The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This is used in the system through the Factory class, which abstracts the instantiation of StorageHandler objects.


```ruby
class Factory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_storage_handler():
        return FileStorageHandler('students.json')


```



 The code itself effectively meets  the principles of OOP and design patterns to meet its objectives and requirements. By implementing the four pillars of OOP and using the Singleton and Factory design patterns, the system achieves a  level of modularity, security, and ease of maintenance. These practices not only streamline the management of student records but also ensure that the system can be extended and adapted to future requirements.



 # Results and Summary

## Results

### Functional Achievements
- The Student Management System successfully provides secure authentication, dynamic management of student data, and efficient retrieval and updating of records. User interactions, such as adding and updating student details, are managed through a user-friendly console interface.

### Performance
- The system handles data operations efficiently using file-based storage, though it is designed to potentially integrate with databases for handling larger data sets and improving scalability.

### Challenges
- Key challenges included ensuring data consistency during the save and load operations,some Json eroors.Olsio  implementing secure authentication mechanisms was difficult espessially with  console-based interface.
 Additionally integration od OOP princples intho  the program and design patterns caused some problems 
## Conclusions

- The system is efficent for small to medium-sized educational institutions. It effectively demonstrates the practical application of OOP principles and design patterns to solve real-world problems.
- As a scalable application, future versions could incorporate networked database systems like (My SQl or SQLlite)  to support larger datasets and multiple user environments.
- User interface improvements could include migrating from a console-based interface to a graphical user interface (GUI), making users working more  interactive  and usable for.
  

## Possible Extensions
